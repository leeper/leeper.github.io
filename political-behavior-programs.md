title: A Rough Guide to Doctoral Programs in Political Behavior
permalink: /political-behavior-programs.html
---

Inspired by [the Conflict Consortium's](http://www.conflictconsortium.com/) [Guide to Conflict, Violence, and Peace programs](http://conflictconsortium.weebly.com/annual-review-of-conflict-peace-and-violence-programs-in-political-science.html), I thought it may be useful to compile some information on academic departments providing supervision, methodological training, and infrastructure sufficient to strongly support doctoral specialization in political behavior. This page attempts to provide that.

Because political behavior is not one of the traditional five fields of (American-style) political science, it can be difficult to identify programs that are likely to support research in the field. This is especially true given that behavior researchers tend to cluster in American Politics subfields at US institutions but in Comparative Politics subfields outside the US, the American/Comparative labelling often produces unnecessary division.

The below list names univerisites to have at least three faculty with known behavioral interests or publications, which should be considered the minimum necessary to sustain a support a doctoral project focused on behavior. Information is also provided about additional forms of institutionalization of the field, such as a behavior-specific workshop and the presence of a physical or digital research laboratory.

There is no effort here to indicate whether these programs are "a good choice" according to any other metrics than those listed (e.g., PhD research funding, stipends, quality of life, cost of living, teaching obligations or training, completion rates, post-graduation employment, etc.). It is particularly difficult to keep information on methodological perspectives and training up-to-date; users should rely on department websites and faculty listings to decide whether adequate and appropriate methodological training is available. 

This is a work in progress. All information is provided without guarantees or warranties.
