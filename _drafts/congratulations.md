A frequent exchange - in-person or online - between two political scientists goes something like this:

    > Person A: "I just got an article accepted at [name of journal]"
    > Person B: "Congratulations! That's huge!"

The exchange is simple and so common as to seem mundane. But is it? What exactly are we congratulating? And why is congratulations an appropriate response to news of the publication of scientific claims? Certainly courtesy plays a role and the excitement of having words and ideas acknowledged by others merits some casual reward, but the idea that publishing academic work is something to be congratulated suggests major flaws in our commonly accepted notion of what it means for science to progress.

*Merriam-Websters* defines "congratulations" as the act of congratulating, which in turn leads us to the definition of the verb "congratulate" as "to express vicarious pleasure to (a person) on the occasion of success or good fortune". Congratulations is a respone to "success" or "good fortune". Succeeding through the gauntlet of >95% rejection rates at major political science journals certainly feels like both "success" and "good fortune" so congratulations on such an occasion certainly feels appropriate in the context. But if we step back and think about the ends those publications are meant to achieve, does congratulation actually seem so appropriate?



 - means/ends distinctions
 - publication as a path to career success
 - what about the advancement of science?
