I recently got a sense from some Twitter posts about me that I may be seen by others in political science as a notable "public goods" provider. This is in reference to my [software](https://github.com/leeper/) and [teaching materials](https://www.thomasleeper.com/teaching.html), which I for the most part make freely available with open-source licenses. The discussion got me thinking about the meaning of "public goods" in academic work and how we collectively understand the provision of such goods.

A simplistic model of academic work is that universities (and sometimes other organizations) pay academics to produce "public goods" (like research) and then individually reward academics for their production of certain "public goods" through systems of promotion, salary, and tenure. That these systems of individual reward only - or primarily - incentivize some activities (namely, the production of peer-reviewed articles in a subset of academic journals) and do not reward other things (like [emotional labor](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1049284)) raise questions both about what individual academics should spend their time doing and what kinds of incentive structures should be in place in light of the need for "public goods" that are not presently incentivized. These discussions frequently emphasize gender disparities - as well as age, rank, racial, ethnic, etc. disparities - in expectations about public good provision. As such, it seems that the disconnect between demand for "public goods" and the incentives to produce them are both out-of-sync but also felt unevenly across individuals within academia.

An answer to these problems that I have frequently turned to is the idea that "public goods" provision should be better incentivized. Researchers who produce software should be cited for that work. Teachers who share their materials should be credited for easing the workloads of others. Those who provide pastoral care should be rewarded for taking on emotional burdens. Peer reviewers should be paid for sustaining the academic publishing system. Editors should have their labor recognized as research contributions. And so forth.

A variant of this reward structure is a system wherein all academics are expected to contribute evenly to a variety of "public goods". In essence, "everyone should do more service." But this kind of universalist argument misses the logic of comparative advantage: some academics are better at one thing than others and we should be incentivized to produce what we are best at so that we are collectively better off. Thus we are left in a world where it does not make sense for everyone to produce the same kinds of "public goods" but we have a system that only rewards certain certain kinds of goods production and otherwise relies upon a system of norms and mutual expectations to support essential goods like peer review and student supervision. Lacking a different rewards structure, all we have is a set of norms. The ease with which those norms are violated (or seen to be violated) breeds the widespread discontent with academia.

Of late, however, I have wondered whether this is the right way to understand the present system of "public goods" provision in academia. Goods provision based upon expectations of reciprocity - in essence, that each individual contributes service to support the whole - tends to fail without some way of identifying all individuals in the community and then operating communication and enforcement mechanisms (see, for example, the work of Elinor Ostrom). As such, I have started to try to think about academic service (or "public goods" provision) not in terms of norms of reciprocity but instead in terms of a [*gift economy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy). In an academic gift economy, "public goods" are given away with no expectation of reward or reciprocity. They are not service to the profession or the community, but pure giveaways.

A gift economy is a closer approximation to the reality that we work in than a system of reciprocal contribution. Academics who generate software, build datasets, provide emotional labor, and so forth do so without a reasonable expectation of reward because no such reward really exists. As such, gift-giving is only possible by those with resources and inclination to give away without reward. In a gift economy, we should not expect others to contribute "public goods" because that expectation presumes the academic world operates according to reciprocity and incentivization of all labor. If we are a gift economy, we cannot expect others to contribute anything. 






We lack both in most areas of academic service and I struggle to see how we could devise effective systems for monitoring effort at emotional labor and other non-tangible contributions. Indeed, a system meant to provide incentives to contribute "public goods" most likely benefits those who generate physical goods (software, data, materials, formal mentoring schemes, etc.) while excluding those who generate equally or more important goods that cannot be easily recorded and shared. Said another way, though it might be easy to devise systems for rewarding *public* goods it would likely be quite difficult to devise systems for rewarding *private* goods that serve the public interest. Presumably the difficulty of devising such a system is why incentives remain structured the way they are.
